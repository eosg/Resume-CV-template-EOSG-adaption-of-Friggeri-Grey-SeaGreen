{\subsection{{\LARGE$\longrightarrow$}\\{\Large\addfontfeature{Color=gray}mathematical modelling and data analytics}}}
{Productively managed interdisciplinary collaboration with  XYZ over 10 years. My mathematical modelling and data analytics research was the basis of clinical trials at XYZ; positive trial results steered current clinical practice to ABC method.
\\[-5pt]

Successfully developed data visualisation graphics to communicate analytical findings. At ABC Technologies, I programmed graphical mapping software to visualise parameters across a silicon wafer from text output of a wafer probe station.\\[-5pt]

Effective multi-institute collaboration where my models linked X data from ABC Institute with Y data from DEF Institute, steering experimental design at these partner institutions. \\[-5pt]

Patented innovations in the ABC project. This work used statistical modelling techniques and involved close collaboration with a nationwide consortium of partners including A, B and C.\\
